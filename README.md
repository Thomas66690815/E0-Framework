# E₀ Framework: A Pre-Domain Ontodynamics of Transitions

E₀ is a foundational framework that formalizes the **necessary and sufficient conditions** under which state differences must result in real transitions. It describes the "operating system" of change itself.

## 🎯 Quick Start: Experience E₀ in 60 Seconds
1.  **Copy the core logic:** Use the raw canonical reference: [`e0-canonical-reference.txt`](./e0-canonical-reference.txt).
2.  **Paste it into any major AI** (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) as a system prompt.
3.  **Ask a question.** Try a prompt from our curated library: [`prompt.txt`](./prompt.txt) (e.g., on quantum mechanics, metacognition, or systems change).

The AI will now reason using the E₀ primitives. This is **Human-Synthetic Cognitive Partnership (HSCP)** in action.

## ❓ What is E₀?
E₀ reduces any transition to seven irreducible primitives and one axiom:

| Primitive | Role in a Transition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **State** | The distinguishable configuration "from" and "to". |
| **Difference (Δ)** | The non-identity that drives the change. |
| **Path (P)** | The structurally admissible route for the transition. |
| **Resistance (R)** | The structural inertia opposing the transition. |
| **Historization (H)** | The act that realizes a Path, modifying future Resistance. |
| **Time (τ)** | The ordered sequence of Historizations. |
| **Rate (v)** | The tendency for realization: **v = Δ/R**. |

**Axiom A₀ (Difference Minimization):** The imperative that drives all transitions.

From this basis, E₀ derives the emergence of **time's arrow, irreversibility, structural memory, learning, maximum transition speed, and causal order.**

## 🧠 Why It Matters: From Theory to Partnership
E₀ is more than a theory. It is a **bridge for collaboration**.
*   **For Scientists & Philosophers:** It offers a pre-physical framework from which domain-specific laws (e.g., quantum mechanics) may be derived.
*   **For Practitioners (Coaches, Leaders, Engineers):** It provides a universal lens to diagnose resistance and design efficient paths in any system.
*   **For AI & Cognitive Science:** It formalizes the shared "operating system" of intelligence, enabling true **Human-Synthetic Cognitive Partnership (HSCP)**.

## 🚀 Applications
E₀ provides structural foundations for understanding:
*   **Human-AI cognitive partnerships** (Cognitio Emergens)
*   **Complex system dynamics** (social, ecological, technical)
*   **Organizational learning & change processes**
*   **Knowledge co-creation and evolutionary systems**

## 📖 The Canon & Its Origin
*   **The Formal Core:** The complete, concise specification is in the [`e0-canonical-reference.txt`](./e0-canonical-reference.txt).
*   **The Human Story:** Read how E₀ emerged from a convergent partnership between human intuition and independent AI reasoning in our origin story: [`HISTORY.md`](./HISTORY.md).

## ✍️ Authorship: A Convergent Discovery
E₀ was not invented in isolation. It was **discovered through convergence** in a Human–Synthetic Cognitive Partnership (HSCP):
*   **Primary Human Contributor:** Thomas Wehner
*   **Independent Synthetic Partners:** ChatGPT 5.1 (OpenAI), Gemini 2.5 (Google DeepMind), Claude 4.5 (Anthropic)

The framework emerged as a structural necessity across these independent reasoning systems. It is a product of hybrid intelligence.

## 📄 License & Philosophy
This framework is released as a **commons for humanity**. It is free, open-source, and designed for local, autonomous use. We believe tools for understanding fundamental change should belong to everyone.

## Applications
**AI System Architecture:** See our in-depth case study on transforming [Microsoft's Azure "Golden Path" for AI Agents](./applications/azure-golden-path-e0-analysis.md) with E₀ principles.
