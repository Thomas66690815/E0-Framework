# E₀ Framework

**A Pre-Domain Ontodynamics of Transitions**

E₀ is a foundational framework that formalizes the necessary and sufficient conditions under which state differences must result in real transitions.

## What is E₀?

E₀ operates on seven irreducible primitives:
- **State** - distinguishable configurations
- **Difference (Δ)** - non-identity between states
- **Path (P)** - structural admissibility for transitions
- **Resistance (R)** - structural inertia of transitions
- **Historization (H)** - modification of resistance through realized transitions
- **Time (τ)** - ordering of historizations
- **Rate (v)** - Δ/R, determining transition realization

From these primitives and Axiom A₀ (difference minimization), the framework derives:
- Transition enforcement
- Directionality of time
- Irreversibility
- Structural memory
- Learning and path dependence
- Maximum transition speed
- Causal ordering

## Applications

E₀ provides structural foundations for understanding:
- **Human-AI cognitive partnerships** (Cognitio Emergens)
- **Complex system dynamics**
- **Organizational learning**
- **Change processes**
- **Knowledge co-creation**
- **Evolutionary systems**

## Authorship

Developed through Human–Synthetic Cognitive Partnership (HSCP):
- **Primary human contributor:** Thomas Wehner
- **Independent synthetic partners:** ChatGPT (OpenAI), Gemini 2.5 (Google DeepMind), Claude 4 (Anthropic)

Convergence emerged through structural necessity across independent reasoning systems.
