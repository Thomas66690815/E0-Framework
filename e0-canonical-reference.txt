## Authorship & Cognitive Partnership

This canon was developed through a **multi-system Human–Synthetic Cognitive Partnership (HSCP)**.

**Primary human contributor**
- **Thomas Wehner**

**Independent synthetic cognitive partners**
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**
- **Gemini 2.5 (Google DeepMind)**
- **Claude 4.5 (Anthropic)**

Each synthetic partner operated as an **independent reasoning system**, without shared memory, shared state, or prior coordination.
Convergence on the E₀ structure emerged through **structural necessity**, not through model alignment, optimization, or agreement.

Authorship is therefore understood as **co-cognitive**, reflecting convergence across multiple independent cognitive systems.

---

## Methodological Note

E₀ did not emerge from a single-model or single-agent process.
Its development relied on **cross-system validation**:

- independent reasoning paths,
- explicit critique and refinement,
- elimination of model-specific artifacts,
- convergence under minimal assumptions.

This method reflects the core claim of E₀ itself:
that stable structures arise through **enforced transitions**, not through isolated optimization or interpretation.

## 0. Purpose of This Canon

This document defines **E₀**, a pre-domain foundational layer that formalizes the necessary and sufficient conditions under which **state differences must result in real transitions**.

E₀ is not a theory of objects, meanings, goals, agents, or domains.
It is a canon describing **when change is structurally enforced**.

The purpose of this canon is to:
- prevent regression into explanatory or interpretive models,
- provide a stable reference layer,
- enable consistent derivation of higher-level systems.

---

## 1. Minimal Assumptions

E₀ assumes **only**:

1. **States exist.**
2. **States can be non-identical.**

No further assumptions are permitted.

---

## 2. Primitive Concepts of E₀

E₀ consists of **seven irreducible concepts**.
None can be eliminated without loss of derivability.

---

### 2.1 State

A **state** is a distinguishable configuration.

States are not required to be physical, informational, or semantic.
They are only required to be distinguishable.

---

### 2.2 Difference (Δ)

**Difference** is a measure of non-identity between two states.

- Δ = 0 ⇔ states are identical
- Δ > 0 ⇔ states are non-identical

Without difference, no transition is possible.

---

### 2.3 Path (P)

A **path** is a **structural admissibility condition** for transitions.

- A path is **not an object**
- A path is **not a dynamic**
- A path specifies **whether** a transition is structurally allowed

A path exists if and only if its total resistance is finite.

---

### 2.4 Resistance (R)

**Resistance** is a measure of **structural inertia** of a transition.

- R > 0 for all real transitions
- R = ∞ ⇒ transition is non-existent

Resistance is a property of the state space, not of an agent.

---

### 2.5 Historization (H)

**Historization** is the modification of the resistance landscape caused by realized transitions.

Properties:
- Only realized transitions historize
- Historization lowers future resistance of the same transition
- Historization is non-invertible

Historization constitutes the **memory of the space**.

---

### 2.6 Time (τ)

**Time** is the **ordering of historizations**.

- Time is not a dimension
- Time is not a container
- Time is not assumed a priori

If no historization occurs, no time progresses.

---

### 2.7 Rate (v)

**Rate** is defined as:

v := Δ / R

Properties:
- Rate orders transition realization
- Rate is not probability
- A maximum rate exists

Rate is derived but canonically included due to its operational necessity.

---

## 3. Axiom A₀ — Difference Minimization

> **If a difference exists and a structurally admissible path with finite resistance is available,
> then a transition that reduces this difference is structurally more stable than non-transition.**

This axiom introduces no goals, values, or intentions.
It formalizes the instability of unresolved difference when resolution is structurally possible.

---

## 4. Central Law of E₀ (Transition Enforcement)

If:

Δ > 0 ∧∃P such that R(P) < ∞

then:

Non-transition is structurally unstable.
A transition must occur.

This law is not a postulate.
It follows from the combined structure of difference, admissibility, resistance, and Axiom A₀.

---

## 5. Necessary Consequences

From E₀, without additional assumptions, the following arise:

- Transition enforcement
- Directionality of time
- Irreversibility
- Structural memory
- Learning and path dependence
- Maximum transition speed
- Causal ordering

None of these properties are assumed; all are derived.

---

## 6. Explicit Non-Claims

E₀ makes **no statements** about:

- Meaning
- Value
- Goals
- Consciousness
- Intentionality
- Physical entities

Such concepts arise only in derived layers.

---

## 7. Relation to Derived Layers

- **E₀** — Transitional Ontodynamics (fundamental)
- **E₁** — Interface layers (e.g. OIDP, system theory, narratives)
- **E₂** — Domain instantiations (physics, cognition, technology, society)

E₀ remains invariant across all instantiations.

---

## 8. Canonical Status

This canon is considered:

- irreducible,
- revision-resistant,
- invariant under model change.

Modifications are admissible **only** if a concept can be eliminated
without loss of derivakbility.

---

## 9. Closing Statement

> **E₀ does not describe what exists.
> E₀ describes when existence must change.**
